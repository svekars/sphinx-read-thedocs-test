Here's the Markdown version of the provided RST content:

`torch.library` is a collection of APIs for extending PyTorch's core library
of operators. It contains utilities for testing custom operators, creating new
custom operators, and extending operators defined with PyTorch's C++ operator
registration APIs (e.g. aten operators).

For a detailed guide on effectively using these APIs, please see
for more details on how to effectively use these APIs.

> **Warning:**
> The low-level operator registration APIs and the PyTorch Dispatcher are a
> complicated PyTorch concept. We recommend you use the higher level APIs above
> (that do not require a `torch.library.Library` object) when possible.
> This [blog post](http://blog.ezyang.com/2020/09/lets-talk-about-the-pytorch-dispatcher/) is a good starting point to learn about the PyTorch Dispatcher.

Note: Since there were no code references provided in the RST content, I couldn't include any code snippets in the Markdown version.
